If there is ambiguity, this market will resolve based solely on the official results as reported by the Romanian Government, specifically the Permanent Electoral Authority (https://www.roaep.ro/prezentare/).\n","outcomes":["Yes","No"],"outcomePrices":["0.0005","0.9995"],"volume":"83408.9","active":true,"closed":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","createdAt":"2025-01-17T21:29:10.059433Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-28T23:44:34.558665Z","new":false,"featured":false,"submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","archived":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"groupItemTitle":"Silviu Predoiu","groupItemThreshold":"21","questionID":"0x5b32843a079e064277a5ddb822a3094e2ee747d0ebae8500918717076de14e15","enableOrderBook":true,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"orderMinSize":5,"volumeNum":83408.9,"liquidityNum":71099.7283,"endDateIso":"2025-12-31","startDateIso":"2025-01-17","hasReviewedDates":true,"volume24hr":1310,"clobTokenIds":["18099471332991903486088086913248963848832912087829006577978140073575093553462","83826762687832639929465477128998506253111712181502079358107157940851994519805"],"umaBond":"500","umaReward":"5","volume24hrClob":1310,"volumeClob":83408.9,"liquidityClob":71099.7283,"acceptingOrders":true,"negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x5b32843a079e064277a5ddb822a3094e2ee747d0ebae8500918717076de14e00","negRiskRequestID":"0xe3fd2dde0f8a1b0be6a7cf711665a563e193c965c0941bfcd4745e190c38aef4","ready":false,"funded":false,"acceptingOrdersTimestamp":"2025-01-17T22:07:48Z","cyom":false,"competitive":0.8003199679231757,"pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"approved":true,"clobRewards":[{"id":"19389","conditionId":"0x155c654b7322057c75a781d8a2741a8cc28f765cedcf5d0747bc000dd5fa70ec","assetAddress":"0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174","rewardsAmount":0,"rewardsDailyRate":2,"startDate":"2025-03-25","endDate":"2500-12-31"}],"rewardsMinSize":20,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"spread":0.001,"lastTradePrice":0.001,"bestAsk":0.001,"automaticallyActive":true,"clearBookOnStart":true,"showGmpSeries":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"manualActivation":true,"negRiskOther":false,"umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","lower_bound_date":null,"upper_bound_date":null,"market_type":null,"resolution_source":"","end_date":"2025-12-31T12:00:00Z","amm_type":null,"x_axis_value":null,"y_axis_value":null,"denomination_token":null,"resolved_by":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","upper_bound":null,"lower_bound":null,"created_at":"2025-01-17T21:29:10.059433Z","updated_at":"2025-03-28T23:44:34.558665Z","closed_time":null,"wide_format":null,"volume_num":83408.9,"liquidity_num":71099.7283,"image_raw":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-silviu-predoiu-win-the-romanian-presidential-election-3RnIiMMHspFh.jpg","events":[{"id":"16868","slug":"romania-presidential-election-winner","title":"Romania Presidential Election Winner","ticker":"romania-presidential-election-winner","series":[]}]}],"tags":[{"id":"101970","label":"World","slug":"world","forceShow":false,"createdAt":"2025-03-19T23:36:08.498099Z"},{"id":"1597","label":"Global Elections","slug":"global-elections","forceShow":true,"publishedAt":"2024-03-07 20:44:01.258+00","createdBy":15,"updatedBy":15,"createdAt":"2024-03-07T20:41:56.773Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-11T22:44:54.535Z"},{"id":"101206","label":"World Elections","slug":"world-elections","forceShow":false,"createdAt":"2024-11-07T23:07:25.512144Z"},{"id":"2","label":"Politics","slug":"politics","forceShow":false,"publishedAt":"2023-10-25 18:55:50.674+00","updatedBy":13,"createdAt":"2023-10-25T18:55:50.681Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-05T21:07:05.081707Z","forceHide":true}],"cyom":false,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":true,"enableNegRisk":true,"automaticallyActive":true,"startTime":"2025-05-04T16:00:00Z","gmpChartMode":"default","negRiskAugmented":true,"countryName":"Romania","electionType":"Presidential","color":"#DEE9FF,#3064CA","featuredOrder":18,"image_raw":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/romania-presidential-election-winner-JgnrmU7FKyKB.jpg"},{"id":"19118","ticker":"us-lifts-russia-sanctions-before-april","slug":"us-lifts-russia-sanctions-before-april","title":"US lifts Russia sanctions before April?","description":"This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the United States government officially lifts or removes any existing sanctions on Russia between February 19 and March 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET.
